This respoitory contains code associated with the SABRENet project in collaboration with the University of Pretoria, South Africa. This repository is an offshoot of code originally found in sabrenet-reports that has now become a package for use in other sabrenet-XXXX repositories. This package/repository contains useful code for:

-   functions that are used across sabrenet-XXXX repositories

##### These functions are used in other sabrenet repositories as a downloaded package

`devtools::install_github("ecohealthalliance/sabrenetfunctions")`

The base is currently maintained by [`r params$maintainer1`](mailto:`r params$maintainer_email1`) and [`r params$maintainer2`](mailto:`r params$maintainer_email2`)

### [Production Base](https://airtable.com/appi9YHtonEpMFuAz/tblOMNLMeu1VwYAw0/viwfBSc2GGtRTGwFb?blocks=bipcGM7IhxLmkIwxZ)

### Repository Structure and Reproducibility (across all sabrenet-XXXX repositories, some may not show up in -this- repo)

-   `data/` contains data from the study
    and a data dictionary describing all variables.
-    `auth/` contains creds for google service account. [Click here for more info](https://ecohealthalliance.github.io/eha-ma-handbook/14-cloud-computing-services.html)
-   `R/` contains functions used in this analysis. 
-   `reports/` contains literate code for  R Markdown reports generated in the analysis
-   `outputs/` contains compiled reports and figures.

### Function and R/ naming conventions (across all sabrenet-XXXX repositories, some may not show up in -this- repo)

-   First level function prefixes:
    -   get_ --> retrieving data from Airtable base
        -   mostly associated with `data_input_targets`
    -   insert_ --> Adding new rows to airtable tables with local data
        -   mostly associated with `data_insert_targets`
    -   modify_ --> modifying entries in existing rows in airtable tables with local data
        -   mostly associated with `data_insert_targets`
    -   process_ , establish_ , clean_ , summarize_ --> all data manipulation/cleaning for insert_ , plot_ , or generate_
        - mostly part of `data_organization_targets`
    -   calculate_ , estimate_ --> Analyses 
        - `analysis_targets`
    -   generate_ , plot_ , render_ --> creation of any saved output
        - `table_targets` , `plot_targets`
  
-   Second stage prefixes (analysis classes)
    - PCR   -- pipeline associated with molecular analysis of samples
    - sero  -- pipeline associated with serology
    - GPS   -- any spatial stuff 
    - diversity -- estiamtes of viral diversity

### Targets Framework

-   Unlike other sabrenet-XXXX repositories this repository does not use the `targets` package because it just houses some functions that are meant to be sourced from within the other repositories

### Versioning

-   This project requires `r R.version$version.string`. This project uses the [{renv}](https://rstudio.github.io/renv/) framework to 
    record R package dependencies and versions. Packages and versions used are recorded in 
    `renv.lock` and code used to manage dependencies is in `renv/` and other files
    in the root project directory.  On starting an R session in the working directory, run `renv::restore()`
    to install R package dependencies.
